# 🍩 Path to UI/UX — Donut Animation Design

### 🖌️ Overview
Donut is my very first Figma design project, created as a practice piece for UI/UX design.  
The design showcases a delightful **donut-themed animation** featuring **Blueberry**, **Caramel**, and **Green Apple** donuts appearing one after another with text transitions — followed by a smooth reverse animation.

### 🎨 Design Highlights
- 3 unique donut visuals (Blueberry, Caramel, Green Apple)  
- Sequential appearance with text fade-ins  
- Reverse animation for dynamic effect  
- Clean layout and color harmony  
- Created entirely using **Figma**

### 📁 Project Type
